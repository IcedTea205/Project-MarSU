        <p>This Student Handbook serves as a guide to all students enrolled in the Marinduque State University to orient them with the academic policies and procedures, to introduce to them various students services and activities and to acquaint them to the different facilities of the University.

            <br><br>

            This Handbook also states the University Vision & Mission, relates the University History and introduces the MarSU Hymn. It also presents the composition of the MarSU – Board of Trustees, Administrative, Academic, Research & Extension, and Production Councils as well as the President’s Staff.
        
            <br><br>

            As the University continually upgrades its quality of services and facilities to provide an environment conducive to active learning, the Office of Student Affairs and Services supports its thrust to strengthen student services through pursuing the policy of total student care.
        
            <br><br>

            Further, this handbook is designed and personalized to be owned and kept by the students. Student Identification and Student’s Semestral Ratings can be reflected.

            <br><br>

            It is hoped that students may be properly guided as to the rights, privileges and responsibilities in this University.

        <h1>CORE VALUES (S.C.R.I.B.E.S.)</h1>

        <div class="line"></div>

        <br>

        <p>STEWARDSHIP <br> Everything that we have today is borrowed. Our influence, our power, our environment and our lives. Let us make use of them responsibly and conscientiously because we will never pass this world again.</p>

        <br><br>

        <p>COMPETENCE <br> An academic institution run by competent people will never go astray. Competence is knowing our job and doing it beyond what is expected of us.</p>

        <br><br>

        <p>RESILIENCE <br> We must be strong in trying times, never to surrender nor believe in defeat. Let failure our defining moments</p>

        <br><br>

        <p>INTEGRITY <br> To be persuasive we must be believable, to be believable we must credible and to be credible we must be truthful. This is integrity.</p>

        <br><br>

        <p>BALANCE <br> Life is lived in harmony. Balance then is crucial to a good life. MarSU embraces the concept of understanding life and how to keep in balance. When there is balance, there is order. This is our holistic approach to the total development of man.</p>

        <br><br>

        <p>EXCELLENCE <br> There is still no substitute for excellence. It’s hard to achieve but it can start as a habit.</p>

        <br><br>

        <p>SERVICE <br> Community service and development is what makes a University/ College, otherwise we become an academic institution for nothing.</p>
