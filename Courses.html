        <p>The School of Engineering was originally known as Marinduque School of Arts and Trades, and was expanded to include a ladderized Civil Engineering curriculum with 44 graduates in 2003. This ladderized curriculum was enhanced in 2008 to include additional skills subjects, allowing students to graduate with a one-year Building Electrician Course or a Diploma in a two-year Industrial Electrician course or a three-year Automation Technician course. Additionally, students can opt to graduate under a single-year Associate program in Civil Engineering or Electrical Engineering.</p>

        <p>Marinduque State University School of Industrial Technology was established in 1952 as part of the Marinduque School of Arts and Trades. Over the years, the school evolved and underwent several organizational changes. In 1975-76, it was authorized to offer a four-year Bachelor of Science in Industrial Technology Curriculum. In 2005-06, it became a separate school, offering a two-year craftsmanship curriculum, a three-year technician program, and a four-year Bachelor's degree. In 2020, the Industrial Technology program became a separate school again after a period of being merged with the School of Information and Computing Sciences. Graduates of the program are expected to have strong technical skills and a sense of ethical and social responsibility</p>
